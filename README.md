# myprofilesetup
Just some profile setup scripts and configs, nothing super exciting, but very functional

Do a git clone: git clone git@github.com:richardteachout/.myprofile.git
            or: git clone https://github.com/richardteachout/.myprofile.git

Then
.myprofile/Scripts/install-home.sh

Note: in case someone else is attempting to use this, you SHOULD ABSOLUTELY REMOVE MY PUBLIC SSH KEY from .ssh/authorized_keys

Voila!
